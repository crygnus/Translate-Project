# Translate-Project
Translate Project uses Google Translate to translate between different languages. Initial support will be for English to Marathi language only

This project is my first undertaking to create a scalable java project. This project will provide necessary packages for
translating textual content from one language to another. It will use translate.google.com service to translate the 
data fed to it in chunks and collect it in an output file.
